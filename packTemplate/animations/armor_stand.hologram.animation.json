/*
I would love to make the ghost blocks snap to the nearest block; however, armor stand rotations complicate this.
Doing it with the y-level is the easiest and works well since you can now place your armor stands on slabs, trapdoors etc. and it will snap down.
The x and z axis are wonky...
45 degree rotations can also be snapped to a cardinal direction; however, the ghost blocks are offset slightly then so it wouldn't be useful.

I also wonder if we could have a "rotation lock" option which makes the hologram render in one direction always regardless of armour stand orientation.
